            <h4>Project Description</h4>
            <p>
              You will create a single-page design that features a sign-up process to get new
              users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an
              open-source community. The goal of this project is to experiment with
              patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re
              offering, which is not at all an easy task.

              Some of the very worst designed websites you’ll come across are for banking, credit card
              payment, HR portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes of customers or
              workers. Self-selected teams of 3 students will redesign a website assigned in class. Additionally, 
              you will add a compelling log in page, as if this were an on-line course for sale. Your redesigned should 
              employ sound principles of human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.

              The final project of the course asks you to subject your group’s redesign
              project to a series of low-stakes user tests, and to suggest improvements to the 
              website, based on what you learn through your user tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should structure your tests around the guidance in Chapter 9 of Krug’s book. You are
              welcome to use as a starting point his sample script and recording release
              form available <a href="http://www.sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html">at Krug’s

                Title the post with the same group name and project 3. Your post should include the names of your group members and the
                following&#x3a;
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Testing script with a welcome to your participant, an explanation of the process, and an outline of the exact
                    tasks you will be asking participants to complete.
                  </li> 
                  <li>Testing notes + 3 major issues per participant.</li>
                  <li>A group-authored recommendation report on the three most pressing issues identified through your testing, including:
                    <ul>
                      <li>an explanation as to why the issues you’ve selected are most pressing.</li>
                      <li>possible approach to implementing fixes/improvements to address the issue.</li>
                      <li>future usability tests you’d run to ensure the quality of the fix.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                Test your site with three different participants <b>not</b> in our class. At least one
                participant should use a mobile device (phone or tablet); at least one should use a
                traditional device (desktop or laptop)
              </li>
              <li>
                When possible, have participants use their own devices (but have a backup device ready
                to use)
              </li>
              <li>
                Figure out how to best involve online students in your group who cannot be present on
                campus for testing; include those details in your site plan
