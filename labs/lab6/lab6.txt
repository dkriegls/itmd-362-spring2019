# Lab 06: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the 
Blackboard interface for a touch-friendly environment.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches or mock-ups, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidelines:

* Gnome Desktop:

* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Create a Lab 6 BaseCamp post that include:

1) Photographs of sketches (or mock-ups) of your new design.
2) An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):
* How you implemented it in your sketch:

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):
* How you implemented it in your sketch:

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
