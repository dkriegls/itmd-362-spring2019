## ITMD 362 Lab 5: GitHub Group Repos and Pull Requests

1. For this lab, you and your group are going to establish your group within a GitHub Organization (see https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-account/), create a shared group repository within the organization, and then fork individual repositories for Project 2. You will also practice submitting a pull request.

2. Choose one member who will create the GitHub Organization for your team. That member can click the + (plus sign) next to their avatar, or go straight to https://github.com/organizations/new 

3. As part of that process, the member creating the organization should also invite the other team members. GitHub may also ask you to take a survey, which you can take or just skip. Finally, create a new repository within the organization. Initializing it on GitHub with a `README.md` file is fine. **That will be your shared repository for Project 2.**

4. Each member of the group should fork the repository (including the group member whose account contains was used to create the GitHub organization for your project).

5. Each member of the group should clone their forked copy of the repository to his/her computer. Once you have cloned the forked copy, you should add the *group* repository as a second remote.

6. Each group member creates their own Basecamp lab 5 post with the following:

A. The name of your group members:

B. The URL for your groupâ€™s github organization:

C. The URL for your shared repository:

D. The URL for your personal fork of the repository:
